# The new web site

Hello,

Here is the new web site for the Portal project.

Recently, I've felt the limit of the Github Wiki to manage documentation per version and tired of its design so that I decided to make a standalone web site by myself. This web site is hosted by the Github Pages. It means all the pages on this site are on the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/flowersinthesand/portal/tree/gh-pages) of the portal repository and fully editable by you.

I would appreciate any feedback or contribution even if it's a small one like fixing a typo :)
